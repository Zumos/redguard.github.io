      <h3>Introduction of Red Guard</h3>
      <p>Red Guard was founded in the game of Dark Age of Camelot. With the launch of Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning Sacrx took over guild leadership and turned Red Guard into the top large scale RvR guild. They dominated the RvR lakes on both the Karak-Eight Peaks and Karak-Norn server. After a intermezzo Red Guard started fresh in Guild Wars 2 where it took several players from the guild Explicit Content. In this new game they dominated the World vs World area for as long as they were around. Red Guard can also be seen as the founder of the Guild vs Guild comptetetive scene in which they have been undefeated till the day of today. However they understand this GvG scene only came about because of the poor and meaningless WvW design in the game. With too small maps, overpowered siege weapons and no purpose of winning the amount of good open fights slumbered. In reaction to this the GvG scene came to life which caused some strong reactions within the ArenaNet team. Currently in hibernation mode Red Guard is waiting for the next good open world PvP game. With the hopes on Camelot Unchained by City State Entertainment under lead of Mark Jacobs, game designer of among other games Dark Age of Camelot and Warhammer Online, we pray for a bright future. The game is launching its first (old school) beta 1 the 4th of July 2018 with launch expected late 2019. As a guild they are part of the Internal Testing to help develop the game.

      <h3>Warhammer Online Era</h3>
      <p>Red Guard started off their adventure in Warhammer Online on the Karak-Eight Peaks server on Order side. Under the command of Sacrx on his Warrior Priest they soon created a name for themselves as a RvR guild. With a server merge Red Guard later became part of the Karak-Norn server where they fought along side guilds such as Black Company, Seventh Legion, Exodus and against guilds like Orz, The Unnamed and Moonlapse. The making of videos wasn't as popular during these times as it is nowadays, but several videos of this era are stored on this youtube account. Below you can find a small selection of videos of the Red Guard days of Warhammer Online.

      <h3>Recruitment</h3>
      <p>For Camelot Unchained we are looking for Builders/Crafters who want to be part of this hardcore guild. Camelot Unchained will have an interdependency where Fighters will need Crafters to supply weapons and armor and Crafters will need Fighters to help them getting the most valuable materials in dangerous territories. If you are interested in playing a Crafter/Builder in an hardcore environment you can apply here.
      </p>
      <h6> We are NOT recruiting any Fighter classes as we expected to unite the guild with players from both the Warhammer era, as well as the Guild Wars 2 era!
